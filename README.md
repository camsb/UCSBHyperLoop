#Cloning the Git Repositiory 
1). First, remove the src folder created when the project was created.
2). In the Git Powershell (or Terminal for Windows), navigate to the project directory you just made. For me, it was /Users/myname/LPCXpresso/ucsb_hyperloop
3). Go to the git respository online (https://github.com/camsb/UCSBHyperLoop) and copy the link by the "HTTPS" button. Currently this shows (https://github.com/camsb/UCSBHyperLoop.git).
4). In the directory you navigated to, perform the following command: "git clone https://github.com/camsb/UCSBHyperLoop.git"
5). Rename this directory back to "src"
6). You now have the latest source code and a working project.
