/*DAC MCP4725
   I2C Frequencies: 100kHz, 400kHz, 3.4MHz
  The MCP4725 is a 12-bit single-channel DAC controlled via I2C. It has one external address bit (so only 2 devices can be used on the same bus.)
  I2C Protocol (Fast Mode; check Datasheet for details):
	1. Write Device Address
	2. 4-bit Configuration: 0000
	3. 12-bit Output Data:
  DAC Configuration (4-bit)
  C2 | C1 | PD1 | PD0
  C2 = 0	Command mode bit 2 (0, 0) = Fast Command Mode
  C1 = 0	Command mode bit 1 (0, 0) = Fast Command Mode
  PD1 = 0 Pulldown Resistor (we don't want any)
  PD0 = 0 Pulldown Resistor (we don't want any)
  Since the configuration is all 0s, writing to the DAC is simply writing the 12-bit output we want.
  There are other modes that allow for greater configuration (like writing to the EEPROM so that the DAC remembers the output after power-off.)

/*IOX MCP23017
   I2C Frequencies: 100kHz, 400kHz, 1.7MHz
  The MCP23017 is a 16-bit IO Expander controlled via I2C; the device is split into two 8-bit ports.
  The device is configured by a shared configuration register, IOCON, which consists of a byte. The settings are as follows:
  IOX Configuration Byte (8-bit):
  BANK | MIRROR | SEQOP | DISSLW | HAEN | ODR | INTPOL | NC 				POR (Power-On Reset) : 00000000
  BANK = Sets the addressing of the registers of each port. (We want them to alternate, so = 0)
  MIRROR = Sets whether the Interrupt outputs are OR'd together. (We want this active for the BMS, so = 1) Does not affect tachometer
  SEQOP = Sets whether addresses increment. (We want to operate in Byte mode, not Sequential, so = 1)
  DISSLW = Sets slew rate function
  HAEN = Don't care; controls hardware addressing on the 23S17
  ODR = ?
  INTPOL = ?
